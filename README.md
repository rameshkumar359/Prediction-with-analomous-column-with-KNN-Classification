# Prediction-with-analomous-column-with-KNN-Classification
## KKN classification is used when we have analomous common with limited domain knowledge about the data for better accuracy KNN could be one of the solutions.
## the Advantage of using KNN :
#### 1.Very simple and effective.
#### 2.Accuracy tends to be greater.
#### 3.works well with many number of classes.
#### 4.Few parameters are required.
#### 5.Works well with features having extreme values

## Disadvantages:
#### 1.the taining of the model is more and requires more computation.
#### 2.Not suitable for very large data.
#### 3.Not good with data having Higher Dimensions.
#### 4.categorical features are not captured that much.
